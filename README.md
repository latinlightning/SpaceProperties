Hello! 

This is a simple forge app that shows a Confluence Space's properties. Properties are user defined meta data that are accessible via the API. This is great if you know how to access it but a lot of Jira admins do not know how to do this. So I wanted to make something that makes that visible so properties can be used in automations and can be visible to all team members.
